            <h3>WHO ARE THE LEAGUE OF HEROES?</h3>
            <p>The League of Heroes is a band of Earth's mightiest costumed superheroes, who use their
            superpowers for good, fighting evil in all its forms.
            The League was founded in Toronto, Canada, by Dr. Goliath and his belief that he could make a
            better world, and that the law abiding public deserve more.
            Since our debut on the world stage in 2015 we have established ourselves as the first and
            foremost superhero team.</p>

            <h3>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</h3>  
            <p>In September 2014, Dr. Goliath left his position as a senior webmaster at Seneca College and
            dedicated himself to full time crime fighting.
            He gathered a team of people with the skills and temperament to make the venture a success.
            The League's first year was spent consolidating funding, acquiring expertise and equipment, as
            well as constructing the Fortress of Justice.</p>
