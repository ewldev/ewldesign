						<p>On a daily basis we see systems that are infected with viruses, trojans and spyware - there have never been so many malicious pieces of software around!</p>

					<h3>Troublesome software</h3>
						<p>In the majority of cases a computer problem turns out to be software related. These problems are often caused when unfriendly software is installed then removed. They can also be caused by incompatible drivers or software.</p>
						<p>Due to the complexity of operating systems, the companies who develop them release regular updates to fix errors and potential security vulnerabilities in the original software. It's important to be using a correctly confugured device that receives regular updates.</p>

					<h3>Troublesome hardware</h3>
						<p>Some components wear out with use over time and simply need to be replaced. Any peripheral devices such as printers and scanners can fail to work correctly for many reasons.</p>
						<p>We use industy approved techniques to diagnose, troubleshoot and remedy problems. If a part needs to be replaced, we'll advise on what we believe to be the most suitable options. In most cases we can fix or source and install an alternative component.</p>
