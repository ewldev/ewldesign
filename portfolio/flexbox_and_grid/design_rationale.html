        <h1>Design Rationale for &lt;musical instruments and lessons&gt; Website</h1>

            <p>The intended visitors of Sonic Music Centreâ€™s web site range from teenagers to mature adults both      male and female, with diverse income and education levels.<br><br>  
                They could be teenagers looking to purchase his/her first guitar, professional musicians who need to acquire new gears, or parents looking for guitar or keyboard lessons for their children or themselves.<br><br>
                Visitors will be looking for inventory and pricings for different brands of musical instruments, range of service provided, types of music lessons available, locations and contact information. Web searching keywords include: electric guitars, digital pianos, keyboards and synthesizers, guitar servicing, keyboard or synthesizers repair, guitar lessons, keyboard lessons, etc.<br><br>
                The site has to reflect that Sonic Music Centre is a well established company, carrying a comprehensive list of musical instruments with competitive pricings, targeted for both amateur and professional musicians. Your one-stop location for all guitar and keyboard needs plus music lessons. A company that will stand behind the products they sell and provide exceptional service.<br><br>
                The site will inform visitors the different types of instruments available and the brand names that it carries. Listing of major models available will include pricings and pictures. 
                Information on the type of lessons offered will also be included.          To give visitors an impression of the high quality music lessons provided, a link to a Youtube clip of a recorded lesson will be attached.<br><br>
                By providing all of the information mentioned above, visitors should have a pretty good idea whether Sonor Music Centre have the right products, services and pricings.<br><br>
                The site should provide a positive impression of the company, with a theme that is modern and tasteful, rich in contents but not cluttered, with up to date high quality images.<br><br>
                The first thing that a visitor will notice on the site is the header, I have chosen the color orange for the header so it will draw attention, create impressions of stimulation and freedom, which is exactly what playing music is all about.<br><br>
                The secondary color used will be Skyblue which also has a quality of drawing attention and creates emotions of freedom and joy, which is also suitable for a musical instrument site.<br><br>
                Together with pictures of guitars and keyboards that are quite colorful, there will be enough variety of colors, so the background of the site will be left in white.<br><br>
                Purchasing a musical instrument usually involved in trying it out personally. Since the site is like a first step to the company, if it provides a good impression and enough valuable information to the potential buyer, he/she will most likely pay a visit to the store. Even if the product is not listed, if the company carries the brand, the model will most likely be available. The potential buyer can inquire through the site or by phone.<br><br>
