            <h5><a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="blank">1) Chart.js</a></h5>
            <p>ChartJs is a popular open-source library which is free, it lets you build responsive charts using HTML5 Canvas elements.<br>
            Currently it supports 8 basic chart types plus animations.<br>
            You can also mix and match line and barcharts to combine different datasets.<br>
            It was released in 2017 and updated regularly.<br>
            During set up, the basic chart from 'getting started' worked as advertized, but the documentation was not easy to follow at all when trying to add options. So I would not recommend this library over C3 to my client.

            <p>Rechart is built on React components and uses D3 under the hood.<br>
             It is free, SVG based, with great documentation that makes it easy to setup responsive charts.<br>
            It has been around since 2015 and is being actively developed, there is an online community for support but the owner doesn't answer questions frequently.<br>

              It is free with straightforward documentation and is very easy to use.<br>
              The stlying is kind of minimal but is highly customizable.
              It was first created in 2015 and the last update was two months ago.
